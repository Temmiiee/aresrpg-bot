// bun run src/cli_train.ts — the actual "learns by itself" piece. Evolves policy.ts's weight
// vector against the simulator through generations of mutation + selection: no game rule here
// is hand-derived, every weight is discovered by which genomes actually won more simulated
// fights. Not deep RL (no neural net, no gradient signal — there's no ML framework in this
// environment) — this is a (μ+λ) evolution strategy over a small genome, which is a real,
// textbook self-play search method, just a much smaller hypothesis space than a neural policy.
//
// Trains against RANDOM scenarios (training_scenarios.ts): varied party levels, varied mob
// families/counts/levels around each party's own level, and implicitly varied maps (each fight's
// board_seed follows its RNG seed). A fixed easy matchup gives a search nothing to select for —
// everything wins regardless of policy, so every genome looks equally fit. Real spread in
// difficulty (some scenarios losable, most contested) is what makes the fitness signal mean
// anything. No chain calls at all — pure offline simulation.
